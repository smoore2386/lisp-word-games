	  comment: Tried enhancing the fit-coords function in the Placement file to check to compare the current input word with the words already on the board; if they have any similar letters, combine the current word with the matched word instead of randomly placing it on the board as with word-search.

	  comment: Did not include the "fits.lisp" file when testing the create-board function for the word-search. Fixed by including the file in the program

	  comment: getting a divisible by zero error. Figured out that it only does this when the input words list is empty or cannot fit into the board.

	  comment: When trying to intersect/combine words on the board, smaller words get replaced by words already on the board; some words never make it to the board because the function never finds a place that fits.
