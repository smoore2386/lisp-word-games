defect log:

		- date: Feb 23, 2013
		  type: Conceptual
		  fix time: 5
		  comment: I found it difficult to create word/hint pairs just based on a space as a delimiter, since hints could have zero or more spaces in them. I fixed this by using the '>' character as a delimiter to seperate word/hint pairs in the input text file.
		  
		- date: Mar 8, 2013
		  type: Mismatch
		  fix time: 1
		  comment: I noticed that the create-board code uses 1 to denote that the gametype is wordsearch, and 2 to denote that it is a crossword puzzle. I changed the create-words-list function to match up with this (instead of create-words-list having gametype 0 = wordsearch, 1 = crossword, 2 = something completely different).
		  
		- date: Mar 8, 2013
		  type: Mismatch
		  fix time: 2
		  comment: I realized that the create-board function expected a list of strings, instead of a list of lists of strings, so I changed the just-words function to reflect this.

		  type: Syntax

		  comment: I forgot to put 'string in my concatenate function, so naturally DrRacket gives me some crazy error that sends me on a wild goose chase. I have the bright idea to try using the debugger, but can't figure out how to set breakpoints, so I end up clicking on "step" a ton of times, since the code doesn't get called until towards the end. As I'm clicking like crazy, I notice my mistake. I still hate the terrible, unhelpful error messages, though.

		  comment: The create-board function was changed to output multiple boards for testing purposes, but we forgot to change it back. This caused the create-board->json function to not behave correctly.

		  comment: There were duplicate functions in the two solvers (brute force and hill climber), which made it such that the two modules could not be included together. Cezar fixed this by renaming duplicate functions in the hill climbing solver.
