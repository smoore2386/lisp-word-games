	end time: 11:45AM
	phase: Group Planning
	comment: This was a fantastic chance to regroup with the old team and see what they've been up to recently. Of course we also discussed some ideas for the project. I was interested in doing some form of image manipulation (blur, outline, etc via shaders) while Shane was interested in doing matrix manipulation. The rest of the group was not very vocal in what they were intersted in doing.

	end time: 11:50AM
	phase: Group Planning
	comment: We came together and decided to make a wordsearch and crossword generator and solver. Everyone seems rather interested in the subject and with all the different features we imagine that we will have a large and complex project to sustain us over the semester. With a deep interest in the project we began work on t2, the group proposal. I wish we would use Google docs for this.

	phase: Group Planning
	comment: The proposal came together rather well. I'm really glad the group is still energized and wanting to work hard on this project. For today's meeting we deligated work for the engineering standards (t3) and the presentation (t1) that are due. I ended up tradeing off a little less work on the standards document so I could get more work on the presentation. I really want to knock peoples socks off with this!

	end time: 11:45AM
	phase: Group Planning
	comment: This was a very productive day. We finished and reviewed all work on all documents so far (t1, t2, t3). Also we practiced for the presentation in a few days. I'm a little weary because some of the group members are nervous infront of crowdes but it shouldn't really penalize us too much.

	start time: 6:04PM
	end time: 7:10PM
	phase: Individual Practice
	comment: One of the requirements for the presentation (t1) was that it could only be 11 minutes or so in length. My part is a bit long at the moment so I'm practicing and revising it to see if I can cut it down in length. Additionally, from our practice earlier I saw that the presentation is really dry, I'll see if I can add a joke or something to spice it up.

	phase: Group Presentation	
	comment: Team presentation day, showing off the Word Games Project. I think our presentation was a great success! (Everyone laughed at the joke.) But Dr. Page didn't really seem intersted in the project, I wonder if he thinks its a bad idea? Regardless, I'm glad we decided not to go with image generation as another team picked that project already.

	comment: Mostly discussion today We used the time to plan out t4, our first progress report of the work we're doing. But at the very least I convinced the group to start using Google docs, a nice way of unifing everything. For the progress report we're going to have a little presentation and have some good questions planned out for Dr. Page.

	phase: Group Planning
	comment: This is our first progress report, I admit, I was very nervous. But it turned out to be a lot less formal than I previously imagined. We discussed random and how to implement it properly. Lots of different ideas were suggested, including Python random, or ACL2 based random.

	phase: Group Planning
	comment: Review of design between members, required new markup of old t5. Our t5 could no longer have revision notes and needed to be more full with probe estimates and a deeper multilevel design. But we wrote it up well and I think it fits better.

	- date: February 14, 2013
	start time: 10:35AM
	end time: 11:40AM
	phase: Group Planning
	comment: Delegation of a new run of work (t7) which will be our first design and probe estimate revisions. Some significant work was accomplished during this meeting. It all ended with a recap on our current progress. It seems Shane might be having some problems with create-board.

	comment: Regroup and talking about some problems shane was having with create-board. It seems that some of it stems from random implementation and the other problems come from just difficulties in ACL2. At the very least it is some progress.

	comment: Meeting with prof and presentation of progress thus far. It was much more lax now, which we are greatful for. Page helped more with random implementation and discussed some of the bugs we are having in the create-board.

	comment: Shane ended up having enough problems and bugs that the group has decided to re-assign Femi to help shane with the create-board. Hopefully the create-board will go faster and better from here forward.

	comment: Sadly not much work was accomplished today, we mostly prepared for the presentation on thursday. I personally began looking into redirected input for the web based frontend.

	phase: Code
	comment: PHP calls are not nearly as difficult as I thought. Redirected input works well for calling ACL2 and returning a function. It did require a bit of parsing for the return string, but overall this came together quickly.

	comment: Clay was happy to let me know that in today's meeting he finished the JSON output. It converts the ACL2 strings to JSON. So now I can pass the JSON straight to Jquery/javascript and have the web front end work.

	comment: t13 and t15 are coming up, so this class time was spent discussing how we would delegate and finish the work for those two projects. Jakob and Femi helped t13 to make the installation guide while Clay, Cezar, and Shane worked on the documentation for the product.

	comment: Shane ended up needing to include solutions with his create-board output. So this required a bit of restructuring to the JSON output, but mostly this was not much of a problem.

	comment: Today we devided out what we were going to do on team Godel's Project. I will be looking into websockets and trying to make their project be available online. Shane and Cezar will be working on a reverse function. And Clay and Femi will be looking into saving (possibly a gif) and loading enhancements.

	comment: After researching websockets and deciding them the best course of action, I began implementing them in python. The fact that Python 3 was chosen instead of Python 2.7 made this rather difficult, but not impossible.

	comment: I was able to show off the initial socket system to the team, which was very exciting, until it broke, badly. So I have a few bugs to work out, mostly dealing with large amounts of data being sent.

	comment: As it turns out, you can't send what I thought you could through websockets. But I rewrote the frame handler and now everything works as it should. Hopefully all bugs are gone and I can begin work on the presentation.
