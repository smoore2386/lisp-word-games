  comment: Did some learning of team Godel's code mainly putting the debugger within the Python modules so that we can find where we need to modify the state changer so that we can implement the reversal

  comment: Wrote all the code needed to implement reversal into the project. Cezar handled all of the gui portions of the project. My portion was to implement the reversal button so that it functions correctly. Rather easy as I am rather adept with Python and was able to implement these changes rather simply.

  comment: Did not realize how difficult it is to work with a random set of numbers in ACL2 and need to get Horizonal placement correct so it is not going into first fit

  comment: Vertical placement was causing problems we were having a collision between some of the horizontal words so they would not be lined up correctly. The fix was to ensure the letters were placed anywhere there will be a collision

  comment: Realize that some of my tests were not appropriate for the project as we have randomness and cannot effectively create check expects.

  comment: Recieve the undefined for zero error for a large set of words which can be problematic. This is because there are not enough room to fit certain words. Switched the size of board to be 2x the largest word. Also may create some type of handling for this error


- date: Mar 16, 2013
  type: Code
  fix time: 45
  comment: Collision problems with the words that are initially placed on the board  the issue was due to the random start an off by one error it seemed so just subtracted 1 from endpoint

  type: Code

  comment: Collision problems again!!!!!! this was quickly found as it had to do with the start point have to subtract one from that as well quick and easy fix but rather frustrating

  type: Conceptual
  fix time: 5
  comment: Jakob pointed out that the letters being placed on the board were following a pattern this was due to the incrementation of the seed by 1 this was fixed and will make it so that the seed is incremented by more than 1 for the rest of them

  comment: Within Godels project we had a Windows exception thrown when the command writer was utilized, what we did was whenever the reversal was utilized the command writer would crash the program so we handled the exception to pass whenever this exception would happen. This was problematic for me as I typically never code on windows machines and never saw something like this before.
